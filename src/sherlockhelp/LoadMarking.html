To load markings from a file.<br>
<br>
In the Display Matches Window,<br>
- Click Load Marking on the File menu, select the file which stores your marking
and confirm the selection. The marking should be loaded and is reflected in both
Match Table & Match Graph views. Note: If you load a wrong marking file,
Sherlock will not detect this, however the system will not crash in this case,
but the markings won't be the one you are expecting.
