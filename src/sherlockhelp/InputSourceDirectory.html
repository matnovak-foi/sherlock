<h1>Stage One: Input Source Directory</h1>
<p>
A source directory containing submissions is required as an input. Sherlock
requires read and write privileges on this directory as the results of the
pre-processing and detection stages will be stored there.
<p>
The source directory should be composed as follows:<br>
<ul>
<li>The directory should contain either a set of source-code submissions or
a set of natural language submissions.
<li>These files should all be in a plain text format. If the files are intended
for natural language detection they should also be surrounded by Java comment
braces. For example, '/*' should appear on the top line and '*/' on the bottom.
This is a temporary measure and should not be require in future versions.
<li>The files may be organised so that they are all in the same directory, or
you may place them in sub-directories.
<li> If they are in sub-directories, you should accept Sherlock's offer to
rename them before it starts pre-processing. This will ensure that no two
files have the same name. The renaming need only be done the first time you
use Sherlock; if detection is run a second time, the renaming will not be
needed.
</ul>
