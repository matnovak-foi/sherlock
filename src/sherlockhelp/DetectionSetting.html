<h1>Detection Setting Parameters (match sensitivity)</h1>
<p>
These settings affect the source-code detection algorithms.
<p>
Sherlock allows different levels of matching sensitivity
between pair of submissions for each line and region
(a region being several continuous lines of coding).
Each pre-processing file type can have its own matching sensitivity
by changing the detection settings individually.
<p>
Before start the comparisons<br>
-Click the "Pre-process File" button or "Start complete search..." in the detection section<br>
-and click the desired the file type name in the tabbed pane<br>
-Then change the values in the text box.
<UL>
<LI><B>Minimum String Length to Store</B>: Lines which have less characters than
this number will be ignored.
<LI><B>Minimum Run Length to Store</B>: Runs shorter than this number will be
ignored.
<LI><B>Maximum Forward Jump</B>: How far to look forward for a matching line
when one pair of lines has matched.
<LI><B>Maximum Backward Jump</B>: How far to look backward for a matching line
when one pair of lines has matched.
<LI><B>Maximum Jump Difference</B>: How much the jumps in the two different
files can vary in length.
<LI><B>Strictness</B>: How strict the algorithm is.
<LI><B>Amalgamate Nearby Runs</B>: Whether overlapping runs should be made into
one bigger run.
<LI><B>Concatenate Nearby Runs</B>: Whether runs which are close together should
be concatenated.
</UL>
<p>
All the default setting values can be re-obtained by clicking "Restore defaults".
