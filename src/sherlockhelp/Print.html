<h2>Evidence Printing</h2>
In order to examine by colleagues and for the meeting with students suspected of plagiarism,
providing the black and white evidence is necessary.
You can print either the whole piece of a pair of the source code
which shows all the matches or part of the coding which shows one match only.
<p>
Note: Because of the bugs in the new javax.print package, some section of this 
printing copy cannot be printed directly, for example, the matched sections 
extraction print out. However, you can select in the File menu to save this 
section in a 160 characters wide text file and print it with external printing 
tools such as 'a2ps' in landscape mode, please make sure that you specify the 
line width in these tools to fit 160 characters.
