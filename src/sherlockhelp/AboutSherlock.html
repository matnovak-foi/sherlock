<h1>About Sherlock</h1>
Sherlock is a plagiarism detection tool for academic submissions, both natural
language (such as essays, reports and dissertations) as well as source-code
(such as programming assignments on Computer Science, Maths or Physics courses).
<p>
Sherlock can be run in a graphical interface and alternatively a command line
front end but the GUI is recommended for most purposes due to its ease-of-use.
One should also note that the natural language detection facilities are not
supported in command-line mode at this time. In fact, we've never had a look to
see if they work!
<p>
In order to detect whether there is similarity between submissions,
the basic procedure is to input the source directory, run the sherlock detection
and examine the results.
