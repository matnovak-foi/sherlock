<h1>Natural Language Plagiarism Detection: HOW-TO</h1>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>
The first step in using Sherlock to detect natural language plagiarism is to
assemble all the work into a single directory. This directory can contain
sub-folders, a suggested layout would be a single folder for each student or
one 'flat' directory containing one file from each student.
<p>The pieces of work must be in a plain-text format, Sherlock will not work
with Word documents, post-script or other formatted files. The software
will work with HTML formatted text but no attempt will be made to remove the
HTML tags at this time. 
<p>When Sherlock starts you will be presented with the following screen:
<p><b>The Main Sherlock Screen</b><br>

<h3>Choosing Your Source Directory</h3>
<p>
Pressing the "Choose Source Directory..." button will get you started. In the
dialog box that appears, navigate to the directory containing the student
submissions and press "OK" when that directory is highlighted. Sherlock will
now use that directory for all its detection work.

<h3>Detecting Plagiarism</h3>
<p>Now that Sherlock has a directory to work from the real work of plagiarism
detection can begin. Press the "Start Complete Search..." button, this will
present you with the following dialog:
<p><img src="freeimage/deleteold.png" alt="Delete old work?">
<p>You must answer yes to the question but it will not do anything to the files
in the directory unless you have previously run Sherlock in that directory. The
program will delete all directories used for old results, but in the case of a
directory that has not been used no action will be carried out.
<p>Next you will see the following screen:
<p><b>Detection Settings</B><br>

<p>This screen allows you to configure options for the detection itself. A
detailed descriptin of the settings available can be found elsewhere in the
documentation. To get started, make sure that only the "Original" and
"Comments Only(sentence)" boxes have ticks. Click any other ticks that appear
so that they go away.
<p>Clicking on the "Comments Only(sentence)" tab at the top will present this
screen:

<p>Most users will not need to adjust the default settings. You may wish to
add some words which will be common in the submissions. Words that are very common are not
useful in detecting plagiarism and therefore words on this list will be ignored.
It is probably advisable to leave this at its default setting as filtering more
than the default words can mean less accurate end results.
<p>When you are ready, press OK to begin plagiarism detection. The program will
ask you two questions:
<p><img src="freeimage/renamefiles.png" alt="Rename Files?">
<p>The safe option here is to answer Yes, however if you are sure that every file
name in the directory is unique from all the others then press No.
<p><img src="freeimage/comparingprose.png" alt="Prose Files?">
<p>Answer Yes to this question. Answering No will produce the same results
but the detection will take slightly longer as Sherlock will also try treating
the file as if it were a source-code assignment.
<p>After this, detection will begin! The detection process may take some time to
complete, depending on the number of assignments and their size. The program
will attempt to estimate how long the process will take. As a rule, detecting
plagiarism among natural language assignments is about three or four times
slower than detecting plagiarism among equivalent sized source-code
submissions. This is due to the more complex nature of a spoken language
compared to a computer programming language.
