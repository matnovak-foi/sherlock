<h1>Stage Three: Examine Results</h1>
When detection process is finished, each match is stored into two ways:
a tree and a weighted graph for different views of the results.
<p>
<h3>EXAMINE THE STORED MATCHED</h3>
<p>
"Examine stored matches" gives the result in a two levels tree.
The root is the source directory
and the first level is the all the file names of the matched pair
and the leaves are the matches of the paired files of their parent node.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Matched Tree</h3>

<br>
<br>
The percentage column shows how long this run of lines is as a percentage of the whole file size:
if the two files are exactly the same, this figure should be 100%.
<p>
The range of the matches are given by their line numbers
<p>
The checkbox on the rightmost can be marked and saved for any suspicious pairs individually or
as a group.
<p>

To examine the suspicious sections of the submissions,<br>
-Double clicking on the row of the leaves that you want to examine.
Then a compare Pane Window will pop up.
<p>

<h3>EXAMINE THE GRAPH</h3>
<IMG SRC="./snapshot/MatchGraph.png" alt="Match Graph"><br>
The data can also be explored using the graph produced by "view matches graph".
Each node represents one submission.
An edge means there is at least one match between these two submissions
The colour of the connecting edges are related to the summed percentage figure
over all the matches found for this pair of submissions. Different connected
components will be shown in different groups in this Match Graph view.
<p>
Viewing the details of the (perhaps multiple) matches<br>
-Move the mouse over an edge or a vertex will show the detail of the
matches/vertex in the status bar at the bottom of the window
-Left mouse click on an edge will bring up a menu showing all the matches found
for this pair, each menu item links to the compare panel, in which the match is
shown. Right mouse click will bring up a different menu, which allows the user
to mark individual matches for this pair as suspicious or innocent.<br>
